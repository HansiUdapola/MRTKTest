# Mixed Reality Toolkit for Oculus Quest 2
This is a testing project to test MRTK with Oculus Pose Detection. 

# Setup Unity Project
1. Create new Unity 3D project.
2. Install the Oculus XR Plugin provider.
3. Import Oculus integration from the assets store.
4. Download the Mixed Reality Feature Tool.
5. Select the Unity project path as the path to add the MRTK features.
6. Add MRTK Foundation and MRTK Toolkit Example. (Sometimes, there is an error after downloading the features; it is not adding the example to the project. Therefore, I added them as unity packages through https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases. [Used version: 2.8.3]

### MRTK Unity Packages
Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Foundation.2.8.3 </br>
Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Extensions.2.8.3 </br>
Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Examples.2.8.3 </br>
